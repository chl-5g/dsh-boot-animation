		* Two pieces of hard-won knowledge live here and must not be lost:
		*
		* 1. `hooks.session` is a `SessionFace` — `ISession & ObservableSnapshot<SessionSnapshot>`
		*    (see `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-session-controller`) — so "this conversation has
		*    no turns yet" is `getSnapshot().blank`. Before DSH 0.2.0 the flag was a
		*    `blankBit` field directly on the binding. Reading the field that is no
		*    longer there does not throw, it answers `undefined`, so the failure was
		*    silence: auto-play simply stopped happening. Both shapes are read, and the
		*    face is SUBSCRIBED to rather than sampled once, because the flag arrives on
		*    a nested snapshot that can settle after the binding changes.
		*
		* 2. The pin is per session, keyed by session id, and lives in localStorage.
		*    It is a client concern: the host never learns a session id from this
		*    plugin.
		*
		* 3. THE AUTO-PLAY RECORD IS BOOT-SCOPED, NOT SESSION-SCOPED (0.4.2). Up to
		*    0.4.1 the record was a per-session "already played" list in localStorage,
		*    so the intro ran exactly once per conversation and never again in it — the
		*    field report was "开了一次之后就再也没有见过" / "是个一次性的". A boot
		*    animation has to key off the APPLICATION LAUNCH, so the record now lives in
		*    sessionStorage (`dsh-boot-animation:boot`), which the browser scopes to one
		*    tab and drops when that tab closes. Opening DSH plays it once; the rest of
		*    that launch never replays it. The per-session list survives as the
		*    documented fallback path (`hasPlayed` / `markPlayed`), not as the rule.
		*
		* 4. Storage is never allowed to decide WHETHER the intro can play. Every read
		*    and write goes through `readStore`/`setItem`, which tolerate a Storage that
		*    is missing or throws (private mode, blocked third-party context, quota) and
		*    fall back to module-level memory flags. Without that fallback a blocked
		*    sessionStorage looks like "already played" forever, or like "not played
		*    yet" on every render — both are real risks now that the record decides
		*    playback.

		* The overlay's host component: the only place the "when to play" rules live.
		*
		* Two rules, and the user picks which one by toggling `playOnAppStart` in the
		* library panel (the value lives on the HOST, in selection.json):
		*
		*   on  (default)  play once per DSH launch, in whatever conversation the app
		*                  opens first — the "boot animation" reading, and the fix for
		*                  the field report 「一次性的」
		*   off            the original rule: once per new conversation, per session
		*
		* A pinned conversation replays on every entry under BOTH rules, and neither
		* rule nor the toggle touches it. The decision itself is `decidePlay` in
		* session.ts — pure, so it can be tested exhaustively; this component only
		* gathers its inputs and calls `playMode`, so there is still exactly one
		* playback path for a pin, a random setting and an auto-play alike.
